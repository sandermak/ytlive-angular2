### YouTube live!

An example application that shows Angular2 with TypeScript in action. For more information, read Exploring Angular2: http://branchandbound.net/blog/web/2015/11/exploring-angular2/

Install and run with ```npm install && npm start```

Please be gentle with the API key that is committed for calling YouTube. It only works from localhost anyway. If you intend to commercialize this code please get your own API key :-).

This code was developed using [Atom TypeScript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript).

Enjoy!
